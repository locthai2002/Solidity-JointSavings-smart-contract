# Solidity-JointSavings-smart-contract
Create a Solidity smart contract that accept two user addresses to automate the creation of joint savings accounts.


The steps for this project are divided into the following sections:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

## Technologies

We will use [Remix IDE website](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) to build and test smart contracts. We will not need to install anything for this project.
